# first-machine-learning-project
create a linear regression model with a simple training set including 10 data (producing f(x) for prediction)

# this project includes :
1 - training set (acording to second hand peugeot 207s price based on How many kilometers have they worked )
2 - a cost function 
3 - gradient decent algorithm 
4 - finding minimum of cost function 
5 - create a f(x) function for model 
6 - ploting training set and f(x) 

# detail 
1 - in traing set all the data belong to cars with have the model (production year ) that belongs to the period of 1398 to 1399
2 - all the data in training set belong to car with gray color 
3 - all the data in training set belong to car with manual gearbox 
4 - our data come from https://bama.ir/car/peugeot-207?mileage=1
